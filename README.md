GDG Nairobi is open and volunteer geek community who create exciting projects and share experience about Google technologies with passion.

What do we do?

We create events, conferences, makerthons, hackathons and workshops in Nairobi, Kenya, with the aim of spreading knowledge about technology and improving the country's development landscape. In addition, the vast majority of these events are free, because we believe that knowledge should not face a greater barrier than the interest of those who want to learn it.

The GDGs also aim to promote relationships between technology experts, so we collaborate in the spreading of other technological communities (GDE, Women Techmakers, etc) to make technology in Kenya a strong muscle and actively contribute to the development within our society.
